# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Not following deadline
- Pushing work after Friday

## Continue Doing

- Communicate on a daily basis
- Helping each other when stuck
- Sharing what we done before committing and pushing it

## Start Doing

- Find a way to track everyoneâ€™s daily progress for the project,
- If anyone has a problem to progress, the other can quickly come to help and
  solve the problem together in order to finish the project on time.

## Lessons Learned

- Try to finish as early as possible in case we face problems
